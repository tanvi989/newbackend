OPTION 1 - Pull then push (fix GitHub first)
============================================

1. On GitHub, delete the item with the long invalid name:
   - Open: https://github.com/tanvi989/newbackend
   - Find: "tanvi.md1️⃣ Point the domain to your server (DNS)..." (folder or file)
   - Open it, then delete the file(s) inside, or delete the folder
   - Commit the deletion (e.g. message: "Remove invalid filename")

2. (Optional) On GitHub, add a normal file named "tanvi.md" with your DNS notes if you want that content kept.

3. Then on your PC run:
   pull_then_push.bat

   Or manually in PowerShell:
   cd "C:\Users\User\Desktop\multifolks\newbackend"
   git pull --rebase origin main
   git push origin main
